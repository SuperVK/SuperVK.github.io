# Day Dreams

All of these projects are written in javascript (except hallowjump), some in pure javascript canvas, some using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), some are broken, some work.

## Hallowjump 
Hallowjump is written using [tic-80](https://tic.computer/), dont bother opening the html file, instead the source code is lua.
